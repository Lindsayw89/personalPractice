        My name is Lindsay. I originally grew up in California and have been living in Lubbock for 8 years. I have 2 dogs named Maci and Aubrey who I treat like my children. I currently work in accounting and have found a new interest in programing. I have been enjoying everything that I have learned and enjoy the challenges that i come across. It is so satisfying to come across a challenge and to finally find a solution to it!</p>
